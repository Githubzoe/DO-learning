1. Test multiple times using curl:
curl http://<localhost>:8080


2. Run a tail -f Command on your upstream_access.log

Do you notice the IP address changing?

3. Open a browser, and step through the app via the
following URI:
<localhost>/examples/servlets/servlet/SessionExample


4. Execute the application and refresh your browser
several times. What can you observe in the log now?
Which IP address is the request hitting?
