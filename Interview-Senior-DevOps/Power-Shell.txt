PS Interview:

$Net = $( New - Object – ComObject Wscript.Network )

$Net.MapNetworkDrive( "S:", \\expert\afzaal )



In here the drive letter is “S:” and the Network share is called ‘expert’ on a computer called ‘afzaal’




Mention what are the three ways that PowerShell uses to ‘Select’?

The most common way is in a WMI Query Language (WQL) statement. 

In this technique Wmiobject uses ‘-query’ to introduce a classic ‘Select * from’ a phrase


The second context for ‘Select’ in PowerShell is Select-String. 


This cmdlet checks for a word, phrase or any pattern match
Another way is Select Object
