Creating Another Super User
While not particularly secure, in some cases you may wish to create another ‘super user’, that has ALL privileges across ALL databases on the server. That can be performed similar to above, but by replacing the database_name with the wildcard asterisk:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ahmed'@'%';

MySQL> SYSTEM mysql -u user -p
SYSTEM mysql -u talha -p

show databases; <- databases list

use database_name; <- switch database


Store IP in Database
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ip_addresses` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `ip_address` INT(4) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

INSERT INTO `ip_addresses` (`ip_address`) VALUES (INET_ATON("127.0.0.1"));

SELECT id, INET_NTOA(`ip_address`) as ip FROM `ip_addresses`;


SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MySuperSecretPassword');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
